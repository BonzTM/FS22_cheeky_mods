# FS22_cheeky_productions
A collection of modded GIANTS equipment, implements, productions, and animal pens.  The mods were created for use on a multiplayer server with a cross-farm economy of ~12 people on a 16x map.

Harvesters have a slightly increased capacity at an increased price.

Vehicles have slightly increased speed/torque/friction at an increased price.

Implements have a slightly increased capacity/working speed at an increased price.

Each production is modded to ~10x speed, capacity, and output; scaled appropriately and slightly balanced for cross-farm economy.  Cycles per month have been reduced while increasing the quantity input and output respectively in order to reduce server load.  Each production is priced at ~5x the normal price.  Most productions spawn additional pallets.

Each animal pen is modded to ~5x the capacity of animals, inputs, and outputs as well as being ~2.5x the normal cost.
